# Basic whitelist/blacklist mechanism for domains and e-mail addresses
# add a single domain or e-mail per line
# default behavior for entries is to DENY or blacklist
# reverse behavior by prepending an exclamation point !
# foo.com    <-- denied
# !foo.com   <-- allowed
#
# More complex/granular behaviors are possible, e.g.
# To block everything claiming to be from aol.com, but still allow a single aol address:
# aol.com
# !friend@aol.com
#
