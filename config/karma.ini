;                          CONNECTION / NOTE AWARDS
; karma can award points by inspecting connection objects and notes
; saved by other plugins.
;
; syntax: lo.ca.tion = N [if condition VAL]
;
; location: an object or attribute in the connection or transaction object.
;           Use the transaction prefix to check only the transaction note.
; N:      a numeric karma score to award: + to praise, - to smite
; VAL:    the value to use in the conditional match
;
; conditions:
;     if match          // performs a case insensitive regex match on VAL
;     if equals         // performs an === comparison
;     if gt             // performs a greater-than comparison
;     if lt             // performs a less-than comparison
;
; Examples:
;
;  relaying = 1         // any true value in the object matches, +1 karma

;                            ASN AWARDS
; Award karma points to specific ASNs. This is much shorter than writing
; result_awards and I score many ASNs. I score an ASN by analyzing the
; past 30 days of traffic. An ASN that sends mostly spam would get an
; award sufficient to "tip the scales" of any indetermine message
; towards spam and vise versa for hammy senders.

;                           RESULT AWARDS
; karma subscribes to each connections result store. Any plugin that saves
; results can thus have those results scored by karma.
;
; Example:
; in a plugin named 'example', a result is saved:
;     connection.results.add(plugin, { pass: 'someval' });
;
; in karma.ini, these rules matche and assign +1 karma point each:
;    000       = example     | pass     | eq       | someval | 1
;    001       = example     | pass     | match    |  omeva  | 1
;
; result awards have the folowing syntax:
;    unique ID = plugin name | property | operator | value | award  |reason | remedy
;
; operators: equal, match, gt, and lt.
; award: any integer (negative values smit, positive values praise)
; reason: an optional human readable reason for the award
