outbound limit control of this implementation works as follows:

1 outbound rates are set in config/outbound_limit.json by domain;
  you set a couple of time windows, and numbers of emails could be
  sent in those windowns;

2 every time an email comes, we first check if more emails can be
  sent to that domain; if negative, push the email into a processing
  queue.

3 every time an email is delivered, an new email is picked up immediately
  to be delivered.

4 when haraka starts for the first time, all emails in the queue dir
  are pushed into a im-memory processing queue

5 a heart beater is used to periodically check if there are remaining
  emails in the processing queue to be sent.
