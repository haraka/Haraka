- Milter support
- Ability to modify the body of email
    - Done for banners. Modifying the rest, not so much.

Outbound improvements
 - Provide better command line tools for manipulating/inspecting the queue
 - Add the ability to force a run on a specific queue file or destination domain
 - Make retry times configurable (handle RFC requirements for 5 days and DSN queued warnings)
 - Disable deliveries for a domain

Plugin behavior changes
 - in SpamAssassin plugin, change default behavior of 'legacy' status header.
   Presently, when undefined, legacy is used. Legacy support should be changed to
   only when requested, with a sunset date.
 - data.uribl; expand short URLs before lookups, add support for uri-a (sbl.spamhaus.org), uri-ns, uri-ns-a lookup types.

Built-in HTTP server
- use the same TLS/SSL certs as smtpd
- auth against SMTP-AUTH provider

Update tests to detect HARAKA_NETWORK_TESTS and skip network tests unless it's set
  (to prevent annoying test suite failures that are tangential to Haraka)
