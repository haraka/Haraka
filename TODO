- Milter support
- Ability to modify the body of email (e.g add a banner)
- Create a config file for each of the core shipping configs, so people have something as a baseline
- IMAP server (long shot for now)
- Plugins to copy from Qpsmtpd:
  - dspam
  - greylisting
  - virus/*

Outbound improvements
 - Rate Limiting (there's a branch for this but it's incomplete)
 - Provide better command line tools for manipulating/inspecting the queue
 - Add the ability to force a run on a specific queue file or destination domain
 - Make retry times configurable (handle RFC requirements for 5 days and DSN queued warnings)
 - Limit concurrency by domain
 - Disable deliveries for a domain
 - Pool connections by domain/MX
 - Enable TLS by default

Plugin behavior changes
 - in SpamAssassin plugin, change default behavior of 'legacy' status header.
   Presently, when undefined, legacy is used. Legacy support should be changed to
   only when requested, with a sunset date.
 - data.uribl; expand short URLs before lookups, add support for uri-a (sbl.spamhaus.org), uri-ns, uri-ns-a lookup types.

Built-in HTTP server
- uses the same TLS/SSL certs as smtpd
- auth against SMTP-AUTH provider

Update tests to detect HARAKA_NETWORK_TESTS and skip network tests unless it's set
  (to prevent annoying test suite failures that are tangential to Haraka)
