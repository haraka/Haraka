Core Configuration Files
========================

The Haraka core reads some configuration files to determine a few actions:

* loglevel

  Can contain either a number or a string. See the top of logger.js for the
different levels available.

* databytes

  Contains the maximum SIZE of an email that Haraka will receive.

* plugins

  The list of plugins to load

* smtp.ini

  Keys:
  
  * port - the port to use (default: 25)
  * listen\_address - default: :: (i.e. all ipv4 & ipv6 addresses)
  * inactivity\_time - how long to let clients idle in seconds (default: 300)
  * nodes - if [cluster][1] is available, specifies how
    many processes to fork off. Can be the string "cpus" to fork off as many
    children as there are CPUs (default: 0, which disables cluster mode)
  * user - optionally a user to drop privileges to. Can be a string or UID.
  * ignore_bad_plugins - If a plugin fails to compile by default Haraka will stop at load time.
    If, however, you wish to continue on without that plugin's facilities, then
    set this config option

* me

  A name to use for this server. Used in received lines and elsewhere. Setup
  by default to be your hostname.

* deny_includes_uuid

  Each connection and mail in Haraka includes a UUID which is also in most log
  messages. If you put a `1` in this file then every denied mail (either via
  DENY/5xx or DENYSOFT/4xx return codes) will include a note containing the
  uuid, making it easy to track problems back to the logs.

* early\_talker\_delay

  If clients talk early we *punish* them with a delay of this many milliseconds
  default: 1000.

* plugin_timeout

  Seconds to allow a plugin to run before the next hook is called automatically
  default: 30

  Note also that each plugin can have a `config/&lt;plugin_name&gt;.timeout`
  file specifying a per-plugin timeout. In this file you can set a timeout
  of 0 to mean that this plugin's hooks never time out. Use this with care.

* cluster_modules

  A list of cluster modules to load. Use colons to separate parameters to be
  passed to the module/plugin. Typical example:

    repl:8888
    stats

  The above allows you to get stats on your setup via the repl on port 8888.

* smtpgreeting

  The greeting line used when a client connects. This can be multiple lines
  if required (this may cause some connecting machines to fail - though
  usually only spam-bots).

* outbound.concurrency_max

  Maximum concurrency to use when delivering mails outbound. Defaults to 100.

* outbound.disabled

  Put a `1` in this file to temporarily disable outbound delivery. Useful to
  do while you're figuring out network issues, or just testing things.

* outbound.bounce_message

  The bounce message should delivery of the mail fail. See the source of. The
  default is normally fine. Bounce messages contain a number of template
  replacement values which are best discovered by looking at the source code.
