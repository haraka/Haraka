connect.rdns\_access
===================


This plugin will evaluate the remote IP address and the remote rDNS hostname
against a set of white and black lists.  The lists are applied in the following
way:

connect.rdns\_access.whitelist         (pass)
connect.rdns\_access.whitelist\_regex   (pass)
connect.rdns\_access.blacklist         (block)
connect.rdns\_access.blacklist\_regex   (block)

Configuration connect.rdns\_access.ini
-------------------------------------

General configuration file for this plugin.

* connect.rdns\_access.general.deny\_msg

  Text to send the user on reject (text).


Configuration connect.rdns\_access.whitelist
-------------------------------------------

The whitelist is mostly to counter blacklist entries that match more than
what one would want.  This file should be used for a specific IP address
or rDNS hostnames, one per line, that should bypass blacklist checks.
NOTE: We heavily suggest tailoring blacklist entries to be as accurate as
possible and never using whitelists.  Nevertheless, if you need whitelists,
here they are.

Configuration connect.rdns\_access.whitelist\_regex
-------------------------------------------------

Does the same thing as the whitelist file, but each line is a regex.
Each line is also anchored for you, meaning '^' + regex + '$' is added for
you.  If you need to get around this restriction, you may use a '.*' at
either the start or the end of your regex.  This should help prevent people
from writing overly permissive rules on accident.

Configuration connect.rdns\_access.blacklist
-------------------------------------------

This file should be used for a specific IP address or rDNS hostnames, one
per line, that should fail on connect.

Configuration connect.rdns\_access.blacklist\_regex
-------------------------------------------------

Does the same thing as the blacklist file, but each line is a regex.
Each line is also anchored for you, meaning '^' + regex + '$' is added for
you.  If you need to get around this restriction, you may use a '.*' at
either the start or the end of your regex.  This should help prevent people
from writing overly permissive rules on accident.
