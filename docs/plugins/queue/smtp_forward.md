queue/smtp\_forward
==================

This plugin delivers to another mail server. This is a common setup when you
want to have a mail server with a solid pedigree of outbound delivery to
other hosts, and inbound delivery to users.

In comparison to `queue/smtp_proxy`, this plugin waits until queue time to
attempt the ongoing connection. This can be a benefit in reducing connections
to your inbound mail server when you have content filtering (such as
spamassassin) enabled. A possible downside is that it also delays recipient
validation that the ongoing mail server may provide until queue time.

Configuration
-------------

* smtp\_forward.ini

  Configuration is stored in this file in the following keys:

  * enable\_outbound=[true]

    SMTP forward outbound messages (set to false to enable Haraka's separate
    Outbound mail routing (MX based delivery)).

  * host=HOST

    The host to connect to.

  * port=PORT

    The port to connect to. Default: 25

  * connect\_timeout=SECONDS

    The maximum amount of time to wait when creating a new connection
    to the host.  Default: 30 seconds.

  * timeout=SECONDS

    The amount of seconds to let a backend connection live idle in the
    connection pool.  This should always be less than the global plugin
    timeout, which should in turn be less than the connection timeout.

  * max\_connections=NUMBER

    Maximum number of connections at any given time. Default: 1000

  * enable\_tls=[true]

    Enable TLS with the forward host (if supported). TLS uses options
    from the tls plugin. If key and cert are provided in the the outbound section of the tls plugin,
    that certificate will be used as a TLS Client Certificate.

  * auth\_type=[plain|login]

    Enable PLAIN or LOGIN SMTP AUTH.  This is required to enable AUTH.

  * auth\_user=USERNAME

    SMTP AUTH username to use.

  * auth\_pass=PASSWORD

    SMTP AUTH password to use.

  * queue

    Which queue plugin to use. Default: undefined. The default bahavior is to
    use smtp_forward for inbound connections and outbound for relaying
    connections. This option is used for complex mail routes.

  * check_sender=false

    Requires that sender domains defined in smtp_forward.ini (see Per-Domain below) have relaying privileges. This is a form of spoof prevention and assumes that any mail clients have relaying or AUTH privileges. This is usually the case.

  * check_recipient=false

    By default, Haraka accepts no emails until a recipient plugin has been configured to accept mails for a domain. The simplest common case is the in_host_list plugin with a list of domains in config/host_host. An alternative is to set `check_recipient=true` and list each domain in a definition block in smtp_forward.ini (see Per-Domain Configuration). An example for two domains:

    [example.com]
    [example.net]

# Per-Domain Configuration

More specific forward routes for domains can be defined. More specific routes
are only honored for SMTP connections with a single recipient or SMTP
connections where every recipient host is identical.

    # default SMTP host
    host=1.2.3.4
    # auth_type=plain
    # auth_user=user
    # auth_user=pass

    [example1.com]
    host=1.2.3.5
    # auth_type=plain
    # auth_user=user
    # auth_pass=pass

    [example2.com]
    host=1.2.3.5

    [example3.com]
    host=1.2.3.6


# Split host forward routing

When an incoming email transaction has multiple recipients with different forward routes,  recipients to subsequent forward routes are deferred. Example: an incoming email transaction has recipients user@example1.com, user@example2.com, and user@example3.com. The first two messages will be accepted (they share the same forward destination) and the latter one will be deferred. It will arrive in a future delivery attempt by the remote.
